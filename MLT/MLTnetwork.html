    <h1>Mobilities, Land use, and Transport (MLT) network</h1>
    <p>The MLT network is a new community of researchers and practitioners from Edinburgh-area universities, organisations, and governments. While Edinburgh institutions are engaged in academic research related to mobilities and land use, projects are rarely coordinated across units or institutions. Although the research is of high quality, it might be further improved through additional collaboration and interdisciplinarity which in turn can support more nuanced understandings of the complex research topics listed below.</p>
    <p>Proposed topics of discussion include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobilities and health</li>
      <li>Urban land use and its effects</li>
      <li>Power and (in)justice in mobilities</li>
      <li>Active travel such as walking, wheeling, and cycling</li>
      <li>Public transport</li>
      <li>Sustainable mobilities and transitions</li>
      <li>Social inclusion and exclusion in transport and public spaces</li>
      <li>Built environments and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Transport’s role in environmental change</li>
      <li>Physical and economic accessibility</li>
      <li>Systems, policies, behaviours, and cultures related to these topics</li>
      <li>Interactions between these topics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The MLT network is supported by the <a href="https://csfl.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Sustainable Forests and Landscapes (CSFL)</a> at the University of Edinburgh. MLT organisers are based in the Research Institute for Geography and the Lived Environment (RIGLE) in the School of GeoSciences. Please contact <a href="https://pdbminer.com">Patrick Miner</a> with any questions or to get involved.</p>
